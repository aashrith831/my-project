# Arduino Temperature Monitor with LCD (I2C) and Buzzer

This project uses an **Arduino**, a **DHT11 temperature sensor**, a **16x2 LCD with I2C module**, and a **buzzer** to monitor temperature.  
The system displays the current temperature on the LCD and triggers a buzzer alarm if the temperature exceeds **40Â°C**.
